============

Captain Alexa is an an Amazon Alexa Skill for reporting on boat times in Boston.  It is primarily useful for a very small audience of users--the intersection of those that take commuter ferry services in Boston and those that own an Amazon Echo. That being said everyone should own an Echo or two!

For developers it is an example of a (mostly) working NodeJS Alexa Skill.
